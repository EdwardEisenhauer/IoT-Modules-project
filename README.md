Range, power consumption and data transfer performance tests in OpenThread over STM32WB platform.

## [STM32WB](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32wb-series.html)

The dual-core architecture of the STM32WB enables real-time execution of both application code and network-processing tasks.

## [OpenThread](https://openthread.io/)

OpenThread is an open-source [Thread](https://www.threadgroup.org/) implementation released by Google.

## Range

## Power consumption

## Data Transfer Performance

I would like to measure the data transfer perfomance, when my device acts as a Router and as an End Device.
